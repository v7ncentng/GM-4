    <h2>Welcome to my page!</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Wang Ng, and I am currently a UC Davis second-year student studying Computer Science. 
        My interests are in cybersecurity and machine learning, especially in the context of training models 
        for practical uses. Aside from the computer, I enjoy lifting weights, reading, and playing the piano.
